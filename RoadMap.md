1- clean up default files. 
2- no coding : thinking about the topic
    2.1. number of pages : how many pages an user can visit
    2.2: think about how many components every page is gonna need.
    2.3: think about the different features the app is gonna have : login, register, search product by name, sorting products by price, by category.
3-Create your 1st component: -All products page
    3.1 Fetch the data
    3.2 Display the data (cards? list? ...)
4-create your second component : Single product Page
    4.1- Start using React Router
    4.2- Build navigation
    4.3: dynamic route

5-features in Product page : filters and search




-General notes: 
    -every time you want to start building a new feature THINK about 1st what the output should be, and then which inputs you will need to get that. 

    -given in which page i want to have certain feature, and the inputs needed, think about where to get those inputs from - Do I have them in the same component? do i need to send them from another component?`
